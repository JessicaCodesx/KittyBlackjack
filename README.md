# Blackjack Game

## Overview
This is a **passion project** and a **work in progress**â€”a Blackjack game built using **Godot Engine**. The goal is to create an engaging, well-polished card game with animations, strategic gameplay, and a leaderboard system. The game is currently **deployed on Itch.io**, allowing players to try it out while development continues.

  - Betting system
  - Hitting, standing, doubling down
  - Dealer AI that follows standard Blackjack rules
  - Automatic win/loss calculations
- **Animations & Interactivity**
  - Dealer sprite changes based on game events (idle, sleeping, eating, excited, sad, etc.)
  - Cards dynamically drawn and positioned on the table
- **User Experience Enhancements**
  - Persistent player balance
  - Game over handling
  - Reshuffling logic when the deck runs out
- **Leaderboard System** (Firebase Integration)
  - Saves and retrieves the top 10 player balances
